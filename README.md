# Clustering

- Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. 
- It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."
- It does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns.
- It is an unsupervised learning method, hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset.
- The clustering technique is commonly used for statistical data analysis.

    For instance: "Music"

    You might organize music by genre, while your friend might organize music by decade. How you choose to group items helps you to understand more about them as individual pieces of music

- After clustering, each cluster is assigned a number called a cluster ID. Now, you can condense the entire feature set for an example into its cluster ID. Representing a complex example by a simple cluster ID makes clustering powerful.
